# check-macos-installer

A script that deeply validates a macOS installer.

Inspired by Howard Oakley's [Checking a macOS installer app is easier with Taccy 1.6](https://eclecticlight.co/2019/10/28/checking-a-macos-installer-app-is-easier-with-taccy-1-6/), but command-line-ized. Tested with macOS High Sierra, Mojave, and Catalina installers.

Depends on [portable-color](https://github.com/mattieb/portable-color), which is included as a submodule.
